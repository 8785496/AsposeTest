## Approaches
* used dependency injections to improve code structure and increase unit testability
* used an input data validation on the server and client side
* used notifications about errors in UI
* used CSS function for image preview to increase the speed of image viewing on the fly. But this can lead to small differences between the preview and the output file

## Installation requirements
* .net core 3.1
* msbuilder

## Improvements
* use different controllers for image processing and upload/download files
